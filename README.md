A simple Base Android template that I use to create an **Android/Kotlin** project and be up and running in a **few seconds**. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this Android project, follow these instructions:

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (latest version recommended)
- Android SDK with API level 29 or later

### Clone the Repository with ssh

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KurosakiKST/base-android.git
```
And start using it.
